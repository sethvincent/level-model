# Tests

Tests are run using [tape](https://npmjs.com/tape).

Linting is performed using [standard](https://npmjs.com/standard)

## Running tests

```sh
git clone {this repo}
cd {this repo}
npm install
npm test
```

`npm test` runs both the linter and the tests.

### Just run the linter

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Only run the tests

```sh
npm run test:no-lint
```
